# Debouncing
Debouncing is a very popular technique to improve the browser performance. Imagine you type something to search and while typing each letter on the searchbar generally on backend a separate http request is made. With debouncing you can prevent this by adding a timeout so that the api request will only take place after a particular time and will give you better performance.
